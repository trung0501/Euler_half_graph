Given a directed graph G = <V,E> consisting of N vertices represented as an adjacency matrix in the file dothi.in in the following format:
    
    . The first line contains a natural number N corresponding to the number of vertices of the graph; 
    . The next N lines record the adjacency matrix of the graph, two different elements of the adjacency matrix are written separated by a few spaces.
Write a program to check whether G is a semi-Eulerian graph or not? If G is a semi-Eulerian graph, construct an Euler path of the graph, otherwise display the message "G is not a semi-Eulerian graph"?. The results are output to the screen.
